Minimal TD game written in Go (with the amazing [[https://github.com/faiface/pixel][Pixel]] game library).

* Roadmap

** Grid

The playing field is defined as a 2D grid. Monsters will walk on the
grid, coming from left and trying to reach the right side.

Cells on the grid may be blocked, making it necessary for the fiend to
find a way around the obstacle.

If the grid is completely blocked, the player looses all constructions
(there must be at least one viable path for the enemies to reach their
goal).

*** DONE draw window
*** TODO Tiled World
**** TODO tmx support

** Towers

Towers are placed by the player via mouse interaction on the
grid. Towers start shooting at fiends within their range
automatically, favoring the closest fiend. A tower blocks one cell.

*** DONE draw tower on mouse pointer position on click
*** DONE make tower shoot on fiends in range
*** DONE define range
*** DONE shoot timer
*** TODO towers should only be placed on the grid
*** TODO tower take time to build
*** TODO block grid cell
*** TODO free playing field if totally blocked

** Fiends

Fiends spawn beyond the left limits of the screen and move (in waves)
towards the right side of the screen. They try to find the shortest
path possible and will follow it.

If there is no viable path, all monsters will die and the player
looses all structures (this still rewards money and might be a valid
strategy to rebuild the field).

*** DONE draw fiends
**** TODO ... in waves
*** DONE Health
**** DONE Taking Damage
***** TODO aminate
*** DONE Death
**** TODO animate
*** TODO disppear after reaching the right side of the screen
*** DONE damage
*** TODO fiends walk on the grid
**** TODO a-star for path-finding

** Economy

The player gains money for each fiend killed before it passes the right
limits of the screen. Towers (and other structure) cost money.

*** Global State for Economy
*** Towers cost money
*** Killing fiends provides money
